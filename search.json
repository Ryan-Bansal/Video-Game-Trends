    "text": "Project Summary\n\n Video game popularity and sales changed dramatically between 2000 and 2010. I gathered data from a Kaggle dataset containing global sales information on thousands of video games released during that decade. After cleaning and filtering the data, I focused on top-selling titles and major platforms across different regions. Through visualizations like bar charts and pie charts, I was able to explore which consoles dominated, how regional preferences differed, and which genres led global trends. Nintendo’s DS and Wii platforms stood out as major contributors to overall sales, particularly in North America and Japan. This analysis helped uncover not only which games were most successful, but also how market dynamics and consumer behavior varied around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest-selling games during this time were predominantly released on Nintendo’s DS and Wii, showcasing their strong market dominance. Genres like action and sports consistently led global sales, shaping the gaming industry’s growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the worldwide impact, this project includes an interactive pie chart showing the regional distribution of video game sales, offering insight into how different markets contributed to overall sales throughout the decade."
